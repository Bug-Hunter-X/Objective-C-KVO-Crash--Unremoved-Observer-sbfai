This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  The issue stems from not properly removing observers when they are no longer needed.  If an observer is not removed and the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  This is because the observer will attempt to access memory that has been freed, leading to a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *observedString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... handle changes ...
}

- (void)startObserving {
    [self addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
}

- (void)stopObserving {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString"];
}
@end
```

In this example, if `stopObserving` is not called before `MyClass` is deallocated, a crash is likely.
