The solution involves ensuring that the observer is removed using `removeObserver:` before the observed object is deallocated. This prevents attempts to access freed memory.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *observedString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... handle changes ...
}

- (void)startObserving {
    [self addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
}

- (void)stopObserving {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString"];
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [self stopObserving];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

This improved version includes a `stopObserving` method explicitly called in the `dealloc` method, guaranteeing the observer is removed before the object is deallocated.  Alternatively, you could call `stopObserving` any time the object is no longer needing to observe changes.
